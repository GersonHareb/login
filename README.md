# Login page v1.0
In construction.

Welcome and thank you for your visit, this is a small project I'm building as part of my Fullstack course homework and to prove my newly aquired skills.
Frontend is made with Bootstrap 5.1 and a little bit of my own CSS code, soon I will add some JQUERY for the more mechanical elements.
Backend is made with Express and DB with PostgreSQL.

Feel free to use this as practice or in your upcoming projects, if you like you can message me for some directions.

Have a great day!

Gerson Herrera.


Database shenanigans:
```plain
  - CREATE DATABASE login;
  - \c login
  - CREATE TABLE login (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL);
```
